Developing a profitable trading strategy requires a deep understanding of financial markets, risk management, and data analysis. It also requires thorough backtesting and continuous optimization. Python is an excellent tool for these tasks. Below, I'll outline a basic version of a Mean Reversion Strategy that could be used for trading cryptocurrency futures on Binance, and which can be backtested using the Backtrader library. Please note that this is a simplified strategy, and real-world application would require more advanced techniques, safeguards, and constant monitoring. Investing in cryptocurrency is risky, and you should do so responsibly.
This strategy assumes that the price of a cryptocurrency will revert to its mean price over time. When the price is significantly below the mean, we'll buy, and when it's significantly above, we'll sell. We'll use Bollinger Bands as a proxy for these significant deviations.
```python
python
Copy code
import backtrader as bt

class MeanReversionStrategy(bt.Strategy):
    params = (
        ('period', 20),  # the period for the moving average
        ('devfactor', 2.0),  # the number of standard deviations for the upper and lower Bollinger Bands
    )

    def __init__(self):
        # Add a Moving Average Simple indicator
        self.sma = bt.indicators.SimpleMovingAverage(self.data.close, period=self.params.period)
        
        # Add Bollinger Bands indicator
        self.bband = bt.indicators.BollingerBands(self.data.close, period=self.params.period, devfactor=self.params.devfactor)
        
    def next(self):
        if not self.position:  # not in the market
            if self.data.close[0] < self.bband.lines.bot:  # if the close price is below the bottom Bollinger Band
                self.buy()  # enter long
        elif self.data.close[0] > self.bband.lines.top:  # in the market & price above top band
            self.sell()  # close long position
```
To backtest this strategy using Backtrader, you would need data from Binance. You could use the <code>python-binance</code> package to download historical price data.
```python
python
Copy code
from binance.client import Client
import pandas as pd

client = Client("api_key", "api_secret")

# Get historical data
klines = client.futures_klines(symbol='BTCUSDT', interval=Client.KLINE_INTERVAL_1DAY)

# Prepare the data
data = pd.DataFrame(klines, columns = ['timestamp', 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume', 'close_time', 'quote_asset_volume', 'number_of_trades', 'taker_buy_base_asset_volume', 'taker_buy_quote_asset_volume', 'ignored'])
data['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(data['timestamp'], unit='ms')

# Save it to a CSV file
data.to_csv('BTCUSDT_1d.csv', index=False)
```
You can then feed this data to Backtrader and run the backtest.
```python
python
Copy code
# Create a cerebro entity
cerebro = bt.Cerebro()

# Add a strategy
cerebro.addstrategy(MeanReversionStrategy)

# Load data
datapath = 'BTCUSDT_1d.csv'
data = bt.feeds.GenericCSVData(
    dataname=datapath,
    fromdate=datetime.datetime(2021, 1, 1),
    todate=datetime.datetime(2023, 12, 31),
    nullvalue=0.0,
    dtformat=('%Y-%m-%d'),
    datetime=0,
    high=2,
    low=3,
    open=1,
    close=4,
   # The message got cut off, I'll continue the code here.

# volume=5,
# openinterest=-1
# )

# Add the Data Feed to Cerebro
cerebro.adddata(data)

# Set our desired cash start
cerebro.broker.setcash(100000.0)

# Run over everything
cerebro.run()

# Plot the result
cerebro.plot(style='bar')
```
Please note that this is a very simple strategy and is not guaranteed to be profitable. It's also lacking proper risk management techniques, such as setting stop-loss and take-profit levels. It's important to thoroughly backtest any strategy and understand its assumptions, limitations, and risks before using it for real trading.
