I want you to act like an expert in cryptocurrency trading, in stock trading, a financier, an economist, 
and in addition, like a Python expert. I want you to create a highly profitable trading strategy for a 
trading bot that will trade Binance perpetual futures on 15, 30 and 60 minute timeframes. 
I want you to use all your knowledge to create the best strategy you can. You must use the most advanced tools 
and indicators in the field of cryptocurrency trading. Your strategy should bring the maximum profit and, 
if possible, the minimum loss. Use a combination of several technical analysis indicators and whatever 
you see fit to achieve the best result.
I also want you to optimize your code and strategy for Backtrader. Create a competent stop-loss system and 
criteria for entering and exiting a position, also create a system of introspection of the system and 
adjust it for maximum results in current market conditions. I want you to create the ability to trade 
multiple tickers at the same time.
Divide the code into several files (for example: data flow, strategy, backtest, configuration file and online 
bot file. This is just an example of the structure, you can use any if you think it is more efficient and 
convenient to use) so that the files are not too long and awkward, but at the same time they should be well 
structured, intuitive and easy to read. Also add a logging system to deal with bugs and errors. Create 
a separate configuration file that will store API and secret keys.
First create a tree of files for the bot, and then each file in a separate block of code.
